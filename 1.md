### NLP at the intersection of three disciplines

- NLP is an important part of artificial intelligence because language is the most prominent capacity of human intelligence. 
- Another reason why language is central to AI is the famous Turing test.
- Linguistics was central to language processing in the past, before the introduction of machine learning. Currently we see a big gap between linguistics and NLP, but the potential for bridging this gap is still there.
- Language processing was one of the first application of machine learning and it remains a prominent challenge.

- Humans use language to name (maybe even to form) concepts by abstracting from real objects and events
- Machines were able to imitate human language without any access to concepts and reality
- Modern machines do develop some concepts, but the relationship with the reality is still missing
